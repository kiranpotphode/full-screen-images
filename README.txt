Viewing images on the full screen. Using the touch/mouse position for panning.

== Description ==
View large images up close using simple mouse interaction, and the full screen.

Add full-screen-image class to image. The one mandatory attribute is either a src, data-image or a href, which needs to point to an image file. You can use data-image if you want to load in a different version of the image to the original source (higher resolution, for example).

You can also pass through titles, and subcaptions, which will appear at the bottom right of the viewer. To do this, you use the data-title and data-caption attributes.

This plugin is based on Intense Image Viewer javascript liabrary by Tim Holman
